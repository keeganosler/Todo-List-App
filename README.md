## Future Work and Extensions

Right now this is the classic, very basic to do list app in React and I have several ideas for improvement and extensions:
* Have a menu where you can select the background colour of your task, thus adding the ability to categorize your tasks by colour.
* Alternatively, have the option to add a title to the task and have ested subtasks within each task.
* Add edit and delete buttons to each task
* Organize tasks in more of a "sticky note" fashion where the notes are displayed in a grid instead of a vertical line.
* Ability to drag and drop notes around the page/reorganize them
